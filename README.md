EasyShop version 2 is a simple e-commerce web application developed with Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL. It allows users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, 
and place orders. Admin users can manage products, categories, and user roles. The system provides secure authentication and authorization for all user actions. we were provided with starter code that was incomplete and contained a few bugs that we needed to address.
Throughout the development process, we leveraged Postman to run a series of tests to ensure that our controllers and DAOs were functioning correctly. 
These tests were essential in validating the integrity and behavior of our application endpoints.
